# Search Algorithms Visualizer

## Description
Search Algorithms Visualizer is a Python-based application designed to demonstrate the workings and efficiency of various search algorithms. This tool allows users to visually compare how different algorithms tackle search problems across a range of scenarios.

This project utilizes CTkinter for the graphical user interface, providing an interactive and user-friendly experience. Whether you're exploring search algorithms for the first time or looking to deepen your understanding, this app offers a hands-on approach to learning.

## Features
- **Visual Representation**: See how algorithms like BFS, DFS, A*, and others navigate through problems.
- **Interactive UI**: Users can input their scenarios or tweak parameters to see how it affects the algorithm's behavior.
- **Algorithm Comparison**: Compare the performance of different algorithms on the same search problem.

## Usage
After launching the application, select a search problem from the available options. Then, choose the algorithms you want to run and observe how each algorithm approaches solving the problem. The visualizer will display each step the algorithm takes, highlighting the differences in their search patterns and efficiency.
